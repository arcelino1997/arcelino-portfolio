                    <h2>Sobre mim</h2>
                    <p>Olá a todos, me chamo Arcelino Santos, tenho 27 anos, natural de Fortaleza–CE e se pudesse me definir em uma palavra, seria curioso.</p>
                    <p>Quando criança, fui morar no interior do Estado, onde tive contato com a natureza e os animais. Fui muito encorajado por minha mãe a explorar o mundo ao meu redor e foi daí que desenvolvi esse traço.</p>
                    <p>Curiosidade esta que me trouxe até aqui a programação. Foi enquanto escrevia as primeiras linhas de código que senti que tinha encontrado meu propósito, minha vocação.</p>
                    <p>Desde esse dia, resolvi aliar minha curiosidade à habilidade que venho adquirindo para, da maneira mais elegante possível, transformar o mundo em um lugar melhor.</p>

                <p>Where does it come from?
                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                    
                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham</p>
